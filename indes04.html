            <p>A reported attack on a relief convoy returning from a delivery in Gaza has put heightened attention on the obstacles to supplying humanitarian  aid in the territory. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said Friday on social media that Israeli soldiers had fired at the marked U.N. trucks, writing “aid workers should never be a target.” The IDF did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
            The workers were responding to an increasingly desperate need for supplies in Gaza, which is facing shortages of food, water and electricity 
            and receiving a fraction of the aid that it did before the war, humanitarian groups say.The Kerem Shalom crossing at Gaza’s border with Israel
             reopened Friday after closing because of “significant security incidents” in its vicinity, the U.N. humanitarian agency said in an update. 
             Eighty-one trucks carrying food and medicine entered Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah on Friday, the agency said, calling the volume
              “woefully inadequate.”</p>
              <marquee direction="left" style="color: chartreuse;">The United Nations will not waver in its commitment to the Palestinian people. Today and every day, let us stand in solidarity with the aspirations of the Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable rights   and build a future of peace, justice, security and dignity for all. </marquee>
